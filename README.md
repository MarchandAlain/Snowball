# Snowball
I introduce here two novel "snowball" algorithms. One of them very efficiently solves the problem of the minimum enclosing disk over a set of points in Euclidean space. The other algorithm addresses the question of the maximal distance between two points in a set. Both algorithms use the notion of ball (not necessarily Euclidean) and tend to run in linear time in low-dimensional spaces.
